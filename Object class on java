                                                                                                     Object class
In Java, the Object class is the root (superclass) of all classes. Every class you create—directly or indirectly—extends java.lang.Object. Because of this, all Java objects inherit its methods.

Provides common behavior to all Java objects
Enables polymorphism (reference of type Object)
Forms the base for collections, reflection, threading, and serialization
Methods like equals(), hashCode(), and toString() are heavily used in real projects
Example:-

class Student {
}

Internally becomes:
class Student extends Object {   // indirectly—extends
}

1] equals() Method
Purpose
Compares object content, not reference.

Default Behavior
obj1 == obj2

Example
class Student {
    int id;

    Student(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        Student s = (Student) o;
        return this.id == s.id;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student(10);
        Student s2 = new Student(10);

        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
    }
}

Interview Point
Always override equals() with hashCode()
Used by collections like HashSet, HashMap
