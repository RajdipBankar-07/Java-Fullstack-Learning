                                                                                                           Access Specifiers
◼️ Java provides four access specifiers:
↬public
↬protected
↬default (no keyword)
↬private

1️⃣ public
Accessible from anywhere.
Can be used with classes, methods, variables, constructors.

public class Student {
    public int id;

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Public method");
    }
}

2️⃣ protected
Accessible within the same package.
Also accessible in subclasses of other packages.
Commonly used with inheritance.

class Parent {
    protected int salary = 50000;
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println(salary);
    }
}

3️⃣ default (Package-Private)
No keyword is used.
Accessible only within the same package.

class College {
    String name = "SKN College"; // default access
}

4️⃣ private
Accessible only within the same class.
Commonly used for data hiding.
Accessed using getter and setter methods.

class Employee {
    private int empId;

    public void setEmpId(int id) {
        empId = id;
    }

    public int getEmpId() {
        return empId;
    }
}

➢ Use private for variables.
➢ Use public for methods that provide controlled access.
➢ protected is mainly used in inheritance.
➢ Default access is package-level.
