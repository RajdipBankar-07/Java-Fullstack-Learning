                                                                                                           Multithreading
⇝ Multithreading in Java allows multiple parts of a program (threads) to execute concurrently, improving performance, responsiveness, and efficient CPU utilization. 
⇝ It is fundamental for building scalable back-end systems, GUI applications, and high-performance services.

➥ A thread is a lightweight sub-process and the smallest unit of execution within a Java program.
➥ One process can have multiple threads
➥ Threads share the same memory
➥ Executed independently by the JVM scheduler

⊙ Advantages of Multithreading
➣ Better CPU utilization
➣ Faster program execution
➣ Improved application responsiveness
➣ Efficient handling of multiple tasks (e.g., web requests)


A] Ways to Create Threads in Java
Method 1: Extending Thread Class
 class Demo extends Thread{
 
public void run(){
 System.out.println("Create thread and run ");
  }

public static void main(Strings [] args){
  Demo d=new Demo();
  d.start();  // starts a new thread
  }
}

⊙ Important:
➣ start() creates a new thread
➣ run() contains the task logic
➣ Do not call run() directly

Method 2: Implementing Runnable Interface (Recommended)
 class Demo implements Runnable{

 public void run(){
 System.out.println("This is Thread Supports multiple inheritance ");
  }

 public static void main(String [] args ){
  Thread t = new Thread(new Demo());
   t.start();
   }
}

⊙ Why preferred?
➣ Supports multiple inheritance
➣ Better separation of task and thread

⊙ Common Thread Methods
| Method          | Purpose                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `start()`       | Starts thread           |
| `run()`         | Thread task             |
| `sleep(ms)`     | Pause execution         |
| `join()`        | Wait for another thread |
| `getName()`     | Get thread name         |
| `setPriority()` | Set priority (1–10)     |
